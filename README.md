<h1>Hello there!</h1>
I code in <b>Python 3</b> most, but I also use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I can also code using Scratch, which is the first language I learned.<br><br>

I've been coding my own projects for a while, but felt inspired to create a GitHub account and explore what other people have been making, as well as making contributions if possible.

<!---
Mr-Cheesey-Guy/Mr-Cheesey-Guy is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
